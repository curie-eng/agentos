"""Read-only access to plugin bundles in RustFS/S3 (mirrors the API's BundleStore).

The eval consumer fetches a version's immutable bundle by its bundle_ref key and
extracts it to read the bundle's own eval suite (evals/cases.json). Uses boto3
with path-style addressing (RustFS), the same construction the API's write path
uses, so the env names line up.

``extract_bundle`` is the Docker-substrate counterpart to the Kubernetes
bundle-fetch/extract init pair: with no init containers, the worker fetches and
unpacks the bundle itself and bind-mounts the result as the runner's plugin dir.
Its unwrap semantics mirror the API's ``bundles.bundle_root`` exactly (unwrap a
single top-level wrapper dir when that subdir carries the plugin manifest), so
the plugin root the runner sees matches the root the API validated on upload.
