"""Completeness + cross-language drift pin for the reserved boot-env policy (#457).

Four guards, all checked at import time (no Postgres, no fixtures):

(a) Every credential-key literal the runner's ``sdk_auth`` owns is caught by
    ``is_reserved_boot_env_name``. If a new model credential is added to
    ``sdk_auth`` but not to ``RESERVED_BOOT_ENV``, this fails -- the exact
    class of gap #457 closes.  ``CURIE_MODEL_BASE_URL`` / ``CURIE_CREDENTIALS``
    are already safe via the prefix rule, but the pin asserts them anyway so the
    sdk_auth inventory is covered exhaustively.
(b) Every boot key a worker-lane producer WRITES is caught. Retargeted in #488
    from ``curie_worker.binding``'s ``*_ENV`` literals to
    ``aci_protocol.BootEnv``'s declared key list, because #488 moves the
    declaration out of the binding and deletes those constants -- the old guard
    would have gone red (it carries a non-vacuity floor, so it fails loudly
    rather than passing vacuously), and retargeting is what keeps the tripwire
    pointed at the real declaration site instead of a dead one.
(c) Cross-language parity: the Helm ``_helpers.tpl`` reserved list is an
    unavoidable second copy (Helm cannot import Python). Its
    ``curie.reservedConnectorSecretNames`` define MUST list exactly the
    non-``CURIE_`` members of ``RESERVED_BOOT_ENV`` (the prefix rule covers
    ``CURIE_*`` on both sides). Fails CI if the two lists drift.
(d) The same parity for the CLI's Rust copy
    (``cli/src/connector_build.rs``'s ``RESERVED_CONNECTOR_SECRET_NAMES``). It
    is a third language for the same reason Helm is a second: the skill and
    local tiers resolve a connector's declared secret from the operator's
    environment or vault before any Python sees the bundle, so the refusal has
    to exist client-side.
