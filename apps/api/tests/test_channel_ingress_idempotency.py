"""T-C10: the ingress delivery guard, against real Valkey and the real stream.

ADR-0096 phase 2, plan EB-C5. An adapter supplies its own stable upstream id as
`delivery_id`; the platform derives `event_id` as
`chn-<channel_id>-<sha256(delivery_id)[:16]>` and settles the race AT INGRESS,
atomically. The kernel's `is_done` marker cannot be that guard -- `kernel.py`
reads it and only much later writes `mark_done`, so two workers can both pass
the check before either writes (case (e) below makes that executable).

The mechanism is a claim key plus an OWNER-CHECKED Lua script:

    SET <key> "pending:<token>" NX EX <lease>     -- one winner, by construction
    then, in ONE script:  GET <key>
      == "pending:<our token>"  -> XADD, SET <key> <stream id>   (branch a)
      key missing              -> re-claim + XADD in-script       (branch b)
      anything else            -> no XADD, name the current owner (branch c)

Branch (b) is round-5 item 1 and branch (c)'s token check is round-4 item 4;
both have a case here, because each closes a defect that a two-branch or
non-atomic implementation passes every other test with.

These tests drive the real HTTP endpoint. Three of them interleave a rival
request (or expire a lease) at the one instant that matters, by wrapping the
plan's own `_claim_delivery` seam: the REAL claim still runs, the wrapper only
decides what happens between the claim and the script. Nothing about the
endpoint, Valkey, or the script is mocked.
