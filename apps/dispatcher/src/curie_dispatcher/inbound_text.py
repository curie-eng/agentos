"""Derive a turn's prompt text from a Slack event, not just its top-level ``text`` (D1).

A Slack message delivered as Block Kit, as a legacy attachment, or as a bare
file share carries an empty (or whitespace-only) top-level ``text``. Reading
``event["text"]`` alone therefore mints a turn with no prompt in it: the message
is not dropped, it is *emptied*, which is the silent-loss defect class issue
#2006 closes. This module is the one place that answers "what did the human
actually say", so the ingest path in ``handlers.py`` stays a straight line.

**Design influence, no code copied.** The shape of this fix was informed by the
Vercel ``eve`` commit ``4464e4d`` (Apache-2.0) and Cloudflare's ``agents`` PR
#2129, both of which hit the same emptied-message failure in their own Slack
adapters. Neither the code nor any derivative of it is present here -- the
walker below was written against Slack's own Block Kit reference, and the
borrowing is conceptual (walk the payload, denylist the chrome, bound the
traversal). That is why the repository ``NOTICE`` is unchanged: nothing in this
file is a redistribution of third-party work.

**Passthrough is byte-identical.** When top-level ``text`` is non-empty after
``.strip()`` it is returned *unchanged*, including surrounding whitespace and
the ``<@U…>`` mention markup the worker relies on for addressing. Every enqueue
that works today is therefore bit-for-bit unaffected; derivation is strictly a
new path for payloads that would otherwise have produced nothing.

**Coverage is partial, and stated as such.** The walker is generic: it finds
recognized text-bearing nodes at any depth, *including inside block types it
does not know*, because Slack ships new block types faster than any adapter can
special-case them. It does not individually render the rich-text element types
absent from the table below -- ``date``, ``file``, ``citation``, message
mention, canvas reference, workflow mention, and work object. Those contribute
whatever recognized text they nest (plus a plain-string ``text`` value where
they happen to carry one, which is how ``date`` surfaces) and nothing more.
This is accepted partial coverage, not completeness.

**The denied keys are not message content.** ``accessory``, ``confirm``,
``options``, ``option_groups``, ``placeholder``, ``hint``, and an ``actions``
block's ``elements`` carry button labels, confirmation-dialog copy, select
placeholders and input hints -- interface strings the sender never wrote as
prose, and both noise and a prompt-injection surface -- so the walker refuses to
descend into them at any depth. That denylist is the whole of what is excluded;
it is not a claim that every interface string is filtered out. An ``input``
block's ``label`` is the standing counter-example: it is *not* denied and does
reach the output, because input blocks do not appear in ordinary channel
messages and the label is authored copy rather than a canned control string.
The denylist is also what makes the attachment ``fallback`` rule correct: a
denied key can no longer be the thing that "yielded", so an attachment whose
only content is a button still emits its fallback string.

**The bounds bound traversal, not just the output.** A hostile or merely
enormous payload is bounded three ways -- recursion depth, visited-node count,
and accumulated characters -- and each stops the *walk*. Truncating only the
final joined string would still pay the CPU and memory cost of visiting a
200k-element flat list, so every budget is checked before descending. Two
consequences are load-bearing rather than incidental: **every** visited node is
charged, scalars and non-dict list entries included, so breadth cannot be spent
for free down a container path; and each segment is trimmed to the *remaining*
character budget at emit time, so a single 10MB ``mrkdwn`` string is never
stored -- let alone joined -- whole on the way to a 40k-character result.
