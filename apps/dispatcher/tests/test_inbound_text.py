"""Pure unit tests for the Slack inbound-text walker (`inbound_text.derive_text`, D1).

No Bolt, no Valkey, no network -- ``inbound_text`` is stdlib-only and these
tests exercise it directly with plain dict fixtures. The end-to-end Block Kit
regression driven through Bolt lives in ``test_inbound_relevance.py`` (Stream
B); this file is the walker's own behavior table: byte-identical top-level
passthrough, block/attachment/file derivation, the UI-chrome key denylist,
the three traversal bounds, and every degenerate input D1 specifies.

Every assertion about a Slack event, block, or attachment shape is grounded in
a comment citing Slack's own reference docs -- never in an assumption about
what the walker will do.
