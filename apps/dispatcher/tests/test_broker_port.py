"""The producer-side broker port: redis-py structurally satisfies StreamPublisher.

Structural-conformance only -- no Valkey behavior is mocked (the real enqueue /
dedupe behavior is covered against real Valkey in test_queue.py). This pins that
the one backing today (redis.Redis) is a drop-in for the port, so a second broker
that implements the same verbs is too.
