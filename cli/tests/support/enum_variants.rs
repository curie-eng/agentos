//! Enum-variant inventory from source, for the `MessageOutcomeOutput`
//! schema-coverage gate (issue #955).
//!
//! Same shape as the sibling AST gates (`support/schema_inventory.rs`,
//! `support/emit_parity.rs`): a pure, side-effect-free `syn` walk over the text
//! of a `cli/src` file. The caller reads the file and asserts; this module never
//! prints or touches the filesystem. It DOES panic, with a specific message, on
//! the three inputs it cannot honestly enumerate (unparseable source, a second
//! same-named enum, a `#[cfg]`-gated declaration) -- see `variant_names`.
//!
//! ## What gives it teeth
//!
//! "Every variant of `enum T`" is a *syntactic* property a `syn` walk enumerates
//! exhaustively, so it is a source of truth a developer cannot forget to update:
//! adding a variant to the enum IS updating it. That is exactly what #955 needs
//! -- a hand-written list of expected variants in the test would go stale the
//! moment a sixth variant lands, which is the drift the gate exists to catch.
//!
//! The corollary is that UNDER-reporting the variant set is the gate's worst
//! failure: a set missing a variant makes the coverage comparison vacuously
//! green. Every input this walk cannot enumerate faithfully therefore fails
//! loudly rather than returning a quietly-short set.
