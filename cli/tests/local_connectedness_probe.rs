//! Issue #1031: the `curie local message` connectedness probe, end to end
//! through a real `docker` process.
//!
//! The unit tests in `message.rs` pin the pure predicate. What they cannot see
//! is the wiring around it, which is where both shipped defects lived: the probe
//! inspected a hardcoded `curie-worker`, a name no compose project ever produces
//! (`COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` prefixes it), so every `docker inspect` failed and the
//! connected path was unreachable no matter what the predicate said.
//!
//! So this drives the real `curie::message::local_connected_transport()` with a
//! `docker` shim on PATH -- the same fake-executable idiom
//! `local_up_fake_warning.rs` uses -- and asserts on the argv the CLI actually
//! ran. A shim rather than Docker, because the assertion is about which container
//! the CLI asks for and how it reads the answer; a live daemon adds setup without
//! adding signal.
