**Kind legend:** CLEAN = a real `Protocol`/typed port class · SOFT = swap via env/URL/prefix/wire, no code interface · NONE = not built yet.

## The black line

Immutable plugin bundles are addressed by a deterministic `(agent, version)` key in
an object store, behind the **`ObjectStore` port** (`apps/api/src/curie_api/storage.py`,
#282 / ADR-0026): `ensure_bucket` / `exists` / `put` / `get`, with the
write-once/no-mutation key discipline promoted from convention **into the port's
contract**. The one backing today is S3/RustFS (`BundleStore`); a future non-S3
backend (GCS-native, Azure Blob) is a drop-in that satisfies the Protocol. The
GCS/Azure adapter itself is deliberately **not built** — it stays gated on a real
non-S3 customer (ADR-0007), so only the *port* is extracted now, not a speculative
second implementation.

## Current contract

The **`ObjectStore` port itself does not require S3**: its docstring
(`apps/api/src/curie_api/storage.py::ObjectStore`) states a second backend (GCS-native,
Azure Blob) satisfies the Protocol without being boto3/S3. What speaks boto3 S3 is the one
backing today, and a config-only swap that stays *within* the S3-compatible family (AWS S3 or
Cloudflare R2) needs no code, only env/settings:

- **Env/settings** (`apps/api/src/curie_api/config.py::Settings`): `s3_endpoint_url`,
  `s3_access_key`, `s3_secret_key`, `s3_region`, `bundle_bucket` (env vars
  `S3_ENDPOINT_URL`, `S3_ACCESS_KEY`, `S3_SECRET_KEY`, `S3_REGION`, `BUNDLE_BUCKET`).
- **Client construction** (`apps/api/src/curie_api/storage.py::build_s3_client`): `boto3.client("s3", endpoint_url=..., config=BotoConfig(s3={"addressing_style": "path"}))`.
- **Operations used** (`apps/api/src/curie_api/storage.py::BundleStore`): `head_bucket`, `create_bucket`,
  `head_object`, `put_object` (with `Body`, `ContentType`), `get_object` (reads
  `obj["Body"].read()`). The current S3 backing uses exactly these five calls, path-style;
  a non-S3 backend instead honors the port's five method contract, not these wire calls.

## Implementations today

One backend (S3/RustFS) behind the port, plus the chart's AWS CLI init:

- **`ObjectStore` port** — `apps/api/src/curie_api/storage.py` (`Protocol`: the
  five ops + the write-once contract). Consumers (`deps`/`gitflow`/`deploy`) type
  against it, so a second backend is a drop-in.
- **API writer** — `apps/api/src/curie_api/storage.py::BundleStore`, the S3/RustFS backing
  (async-offloaded boto3); client built by the shared `build_s3_client` factory.
- **Worker reader** — `apps/worker/src/curie_worker/bundle_store.py::BundleReader`: a local `BundleReader`
  Protocol (the read-only slice of the port; the worker does not import the API
package) with `BundleStore` as its S3/RustFS backing.
- **Chart bundle-fetch init** — `charts/curie/templates/agent-sandbox.yaml`
  uses the AWS CLI, still a third dialect of the same S3 protocol.

## Known leakage

The port now names the contract, but two physically separate S3 clients remain
(API/worker) plus the chart's AWS CLI init. Fully unifying the client construction
and the AWS CLI path is left for when a second, non-S3 backend actually lands, at
which point the adapter is a drop-in `ObjectStore`/`BundleReader` rather than a
three-site sweep. Building that adapter ahead of a real non-S3 customer is still
out of scope (ADR-0007, ADR-0026).

A second non-S3 backend is **two adapters, not one**: the API owns the full **async**
`ObjectStore` port (`apps/api/src/curie_api/storage.py::ObjectStore`, `async` methods),
while the worker reads through a separate **sync** `BundleReader` slice
(`apps/worker/src/curie_worker/bundle_store.py::BundleReader`, a plain `get`) because it
deliberately does not import the API package. A GCS/Azure backend must therefore supply
both an async and a sync implementation.
