"""Shared worker/dispatcher settings plumbing (#496).

The worker and dispatcher are separate services that nonetheless read the SAME
handful of platform env vars (the API base URL + key, the runs stream, the
heartbeat file + interval, the shimmer flag). Those names used to be hand-mirrored
as string literals in each service's pydantic config, so a rename could drift one
out of sync with the other. They are declared ONCE here and imported by both.

This module also owns the one-release deprecation of the platform-API-base-URL
env name: the canonical name is ``CURIE_API_URL`` (the name the CLI and the
platform API already use), and the services' historical ``CURIE_API_BASE_URL``
is accepted as a deprecated alias that logs a warning naming the replacement.

    The worker's delivery cap (ADR-0039, #505) moves a permanently-failing entry
    to this graveyard, and the API's dead-letter watcher (#531) plus the
    ResumeQueue backstop (#532) READ it. Both sides derive the name from the same
    two operator inputs -- the base runs stream (``CURIE_STREAM``) and the
    explicit override (``CURIE_DEAD_LETTER_STREAM``) -- so the writer and the
    readers can never point at different streams. That drift was issue #668: the
    API hardcoded ``<runs_stream>:dead`` and ignored the override, so any operator
    override silently blinded the watcher while the worker dead-lettered elsewhere.

    An empty ``override`` derives ``<stream>:dead`` (the default graveyard); a
    non-empty ``override`` is the graveyard name verbatim. This is a plain
    function, NOT a wire/Pydantic model: like the transport-literal constants
    above it is absent from the JSON Schema and the wire fingerprint, so it forces
    no PROTOCOL_VERSION bump. Each lane binds ``stream``/``override`` through its
