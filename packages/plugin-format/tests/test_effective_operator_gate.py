"""Unit table for the shared operator-gate normalization helpers (#703).

``effective_operator_gates(bundle_name, servers, name, connector_servers=...)`` maps
an operator-supplied
``CURIE_APPROVAL_REQUIRED_TOOLS`` name to the NON-EMPTY frozenset of live runtime
tool names it arms: the rewritten effective name the SDK plugin-prefixes a bundle
MCP tool to, the name verbatim when it needs no rewrite (a built-in, an
already-effective name, or a ``connectors.yaml`` connector tool), BOTH live forms
when a connector and a declared MCP server of different names each match it
(#1564), or ``None`` when it is an unresolvable ``mcp__`` shorthand (the caller
fails closed). ``declared_mcp_server_names(root)`` reads the bundle's declared MCP
server names (inline manifest ``mcpServers`` + root ``.mcp.json``) with the same
poison-to-``None`` semantics as ``validate._validate_mcp``;
``connector_server_names(root)`` reads the ``connectors.yaml`` half with the same
semantics (#1495).

The ``mcp__plugin_<bundle>_<server>__`` prefix is the exact shape the deploy
validator asserts (validate.py:
    ``expected_prefixes = {f"mcp__plugin_{manifest.name}_{s}__" for s in mcp_servers}``
), so this helper and the validator normalize identically by construction (#453).
The connector half asserts the OTHER prefix, the bare ``mcp__<connector>__``, since
the runner mounts a connector on ``ClaudeAgentOptions.mcp_servers`` instead of
loading it as a plugin.
